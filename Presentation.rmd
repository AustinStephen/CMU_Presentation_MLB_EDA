## MLB Batted Balls Data
* <p> Exclusively 2021 season data </p>
* <p> Excludes strikes and balls </p>
* <p> Examining a subset of the game of baseball </p>
* <p> Exploring different conditions influence outcomes </p>

???
* The title of our data set is batted balls and it is focused on only the plays
in baseball that are hit. Aka we are not looking at balls and strikes  
* The natural direction of our exploration is how the play develops based around 
different game conditions and this acts as the umbrella of our exploration    
* Notably this subset of the game precludes any analysis on batting or pitching 
efficiency and rather directs us to examine post hit features of the game

## Hit Location (hyp. 1)
How does hit location influence bases taken?  

--
  
```{r,  warning=FALSE}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>%
  filter(events %in% c("single","double","triple","home_run")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hc_x, y= -1 *hc_y))+
  geom_point(size = .25, alpha= .75, color = "#c48000")+
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~bases_covered)+
  labs( x = "", y= "")

```
???
You can tell hit location really plays an impact on where runners end up.

## Hit Location (hyp. 1)

How does batters handedness influence hit location?

--
  
```{r warning=FALSE}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bb_type)) %>%
  mutate(bb_type = case_when(
                  bb_type == "fly_ball" ~ "fly ball",
                  bb_type == "ground_ball" ~ "ground ball",
                  bb_type == "line_drive" ~ " line drive",
                  TRUE ~ bb_type
                  )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hc_x, y= -1 *hc_y))+
  geom_point(size = .75, alpha= .10, aes(color=stand))+
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~bb_type)+
  labs(x = "", y= "")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#003063", "#c48000"))
```

???
* Look at how the handedness of a hitter impacts not just where the ball is placed 
but depending on the type of hit it can flip. 

* Now we know hit location is an important factor in running triple. And we know
left handed hitters are more prone to hit a fly ball into right field. So the
next natural question is are left handed hitters more likely to hit triples.
And sure enough in 2021 .648 percent of left handed hits were triples and .52 
percent of right handed hits were triples.

## Bases Taken (hyp. 2)
With what frequency are different bases taken?

--

```{r}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>%
  filter(events %in% c("single","double","triple","home_run")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bases_covered))+
  geom_bar(mapping = )+
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "# of bases run")
```

???
Just discuss frequency
---
## Bases Taken (hyp. 2)
Is the base taken a function of hit distance?

--

```{r}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>%
  filter(events %in% c("single","double","triple","home_run")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bases_covered, y=hit_distance_sc))+
  geom_point(alpha = .02, size = 1.5)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs( x= "# of bases run", y= "distance of hit (ft)")
```

???
Yes it is. A few things to note this removes plays classified as errors because we
are interested in what can be expected under normal circumstances.

## Bases Taken (hyp. 2)
Who is the most efficient base runner this year?   

--

```{r out.height="60%"}
summary_stats_by_hitter %>%
  filter(total_bases_taken > 30 & total_hit_distance > 500) %>%
  mutate(ft_hit_per_base = total_hit_distance/total_bases_taken) %>%
  arrange(ft_hit_per_base) %>%
  select(player_name,total_bases_taken, total_hit_distance, ft_hit_per_base) %>%
  rename("Player Name" = player_name,  
         "Distance Per Base Taken" = ft_hit_per_base, 
         "Hit Distance" = total_hit_distance,
         "Bases" = total_bases_taken) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Best Base Runners in 2021**")
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(md("data courtesy of baseballsavant.com")) %>%
  opt_table_outline( style = "solid", width = px(5), color = "darkgrey")
```

???
Filtered for hitters that have at least 30 bases and hit for a total of at 
least 200 ft on the season to remove any runners that had a few lucky runs. 
One stood out above the rest.

## R Shiny Demo (hyp. 3)
How Does Variability In Baseball Stadiums Impact Batting Statistics?

<!-- - Variability in MLB Baseball Stadium stems from **stadium design and stadium location** -->

<!-- - One school of thought suggests that the height of a stadium's outfield wall has some affect on batting statistics (i.e. Fenway Park's notorious "Green Monster") -->

<!-- - Another school of thought suggsets that stadiums at a higher altitude offer conditions for faster balls, and longer hit distances  -->

## Investigating Correlation (hyp. 3)

```{r}
v3 <- readRDS("adhvaith_table.rds")
v3 %>%
gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Most Correlated Batting and Stadium Statistics**")
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(md("data courtesy of baseballsavant.com")) %>%
  opt_table_outline( style = "solid", width = px(5), color = "darkgrey")
```

##Conclusion

* Hit location is not uniformly distributed
  + Nonobvious player features influence hit location outcomes  
<p> </p>  

* Bases run is a function of hit distance 
  + Some batters are more efficient base runners  
<p> </p>
* <p> Different stadiums affect game outcomes </p>
* <p> Type of hit may be a feature of the data </p>
