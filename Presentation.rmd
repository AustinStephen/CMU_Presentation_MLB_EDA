## MLB Batted Balls Data
* <p> Exclusively 2021 season data </p>
* <p> Excludes strikes and balls </p>
* <p> Examining a subset of the game of baseball </p>
* <p> Exploring different conditions influence outcomes </p>

???
* The title of our data set is batted balls and it is focused on only the plays
in baseball that are hit. Aka we are not looking at balls and strikes  
* The natural direction of our exploration is how the play develops based around 
different game conditions and this acts as the umbrella of our exploration    
* Notably this subset of the game precludes any analysis on batting or pitching 
efficiency and rather directs us to examine post hit features of the game

## Hit Location (hyp. 1)
How does hit location influence bases taken?  

--
  
```{r,  warning=FALSE}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>%
  filter(events %in% c("single","double","triple","home_run")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hc_x, y= -1 *hc_y))+
  geom_point(size = .25, alpha= .75, color = "#c48000")+
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~bases_covered)+
  labs( x = "", y= "")

```
???
You can tell hit location really plays an impact on where runners end up.

## Hit Location (hyp. 1)

How does batters handedness influence hit location?

--
  
```{r warning=FALSE}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bb_type)) %>%
  mutate(bb_type = case_when(
                  bb_type == "fly_ball" ~ "fly ball",
                  bb_type == "ground_ball" ~ "ground ball",
                  bb_type == "line_drive" ~ " line drive",
                  TRUE ~ bb_type
                  )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hc_x, y= -1 *hc_y), alpha=1)+
  geom_point(size = .75, alpha= .10, aes(color=stand))+
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())+
  facet_wrap(~bb_type)+
  labs(x = "", y= "")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#003063", "#c48000"))+
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size=4)))
```

???
* Look at how the handedness of a hitter impacts not just where the ball is placed 
but depending on the type of hit it can flip. 

* Now we know hit location is an important factor in running triple. And we know
left handed hitters are more prone to hit a fly ball into right field. So the
next natural question is are left handed hitters more likely to hit triples.
And sure enough in 2021 .648 percent of left handed hits were triples and .52 
percent of right handed hits were triples.

## Bases Taken (hyp. 2)
With what frequency are different bases taken?

--

```{r}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>%
  filter(events %in% c("single","double","triple","home_run")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bases_covered))+
  geom_bar(mapping = )+
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "# of bases run")
```

???
Just discuss frequency
---
## Bases Taken (hyp. 2)
Is the base taken a function of hit distance?

--

```{r}
mlb_batted_balls_2021 %>%
  filter(events %in% c("single","double","triple","home_run")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bases_covered, y=hit_distance_sc))+
  geom_point(alpha = .02, size = 1.5)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs( x= "# of bases run", y= "distance of hit (ft)")
```

???
Yes it is. A few things to note this removes plays classified as errors because we
are interested in what can be expected under normal circumstances.

---
## Bases Taken (hyp. 2)
Who is the most efficient base runner this year?   

--

```{r out.height="60%"}
summary_stats_by_hitter %>%
  filter(total_bases_taken > 30 & total_hit_distance > 500) %>%
  mutate(ft_hit_per_base = total_hit_distance/total_bases_taken) %>%
  arrange(ft_hit_per_base) %>%
  select(player_name,total_bases_taken, total_hit_distance, ft_hit_per_base) %>%
  rename("Player Name" = player_name,  
         "Distance Per Base Taken" = ft_hit_per_base, 
         "Hit Distance" = total_hit_distance,
         "Bases" = total_bases_taken) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Best Base Runners in 2021**")
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(md("data courtesy of baseballsavant.com")) %>%
  opt_table_outline( style = "solid", width = px(5), color = "darkgrey")
```

???
Filtered for hitters that have at least 30 bases and hit for a total of at 
least 200 ft on the season to remove any runners that had a few lucky runs. 
One stood out above the rest.

## What is the Ideal Launch Angle for a Batted Ball? 

```{r echo = FALSE}
better_players %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = launch_angle,
             y = hit_distance_sc)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Launch Angle",
       y = "Hit Distance")
```

??? 
- One interesting relationship we looked at was the affect of the launch angle of the bat hitting the ball on the hit distance. This plot was filtered for batters with more than 15 at bats, so batters who played more games. There is clearly a desirable launch angle of around 30-50 degrees that is associated with a farther hit distance. We wanted to look into these two variables as a clustering example, as hypothetically it would make sense if certain hit types as well as certain events (like singles, doubles, triples, outs) might be in different clusters of this relationship.
---

## Clustering 
Clustering using scaled k-means
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(cluster)
# complete_df <- na.omit(better_players)
complete_df <- better_players
num_cols <- unlist(lapply(complete_df, is.numeric))
complete_df <- complete_df[ , num_cols]
complete_df <- scale(complete_df)

library(flexclust)

complete_df <- as.data.frame((complete_df))


init_mlb_kmeans <- 
  kmeans(dplyr::select(complete_df,
                       "launch_angle", "hit_distance_sc"),
         algorithm = "Lloyd", centers = 4, nstart = 30)

complete_df %>%
  mutate(ball_clusters = as.factor(init_mlb_kmeans$cluster)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = launch_angle, y = hit_distance_sc,
             color = ball_clusters)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  theme_bw() +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Launch Angle",
       y = "Hit Distance",
       color = "Balls Batted Clusters")
```
???
I used k-means clustering because we were only looking at two variables and the scatterplot of launch angle and hit distance did not have a lot of outliers. Because launch angle and hit distance are measured using different variables, degrees and feet, I scaled the variables to make their variances more similar, as unequal variances can lead to putting more weight on variables with smaller variance. Clusters would've just been separated along hit distance, as this variable has a higher variance than launch angle.

Using k = 4 here after using an elbow plot, which is a naiive method for choosing k but the 4 groups here seem to make logical sense. There is a group with a very low distance and launch angle, a group with a slightly higher launch angle and a growing hit distance, a group with a launch angle from around 30-50 degrees and the highest distance (this would be "optimal") and a group with a higher launch angle and a similar hit distance to the second group


```{r echo = FALSE}
# mlb_kmeanspp <-
#   kcca(dplyr::select(complete_df, launch_angle, hit_distance_sc), 
#        k = 3, control = list(initcent = "kmeanspp"))
# 
# complete_df %>%
#   mutate(ball_clusters = 
#            as.factor(mlb_kmeanspp@cluster)) %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = launch_angle, y = hit_distance_sc,
#              color = ball_clusters)) +
#   geom_point(alpha = 0.75) + 
#   theme_bw() +
#   ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
# 
# ball_dist <- 
#   dist(dplyr::select(complete_df, launch_angle, hit_distance_sc))
# ball_dist_matrix <- as.matrix(ball_dist)
# rownames(ball_dist_matrix) <- complete_df$batter
# colnames(ball_dist_matrix) <- complete_df$batter
# ball_dist_matrix[1:3, 1:3]
# 
# long_dist_matrix <- 
#   as_tibble(ball_dist_matrix) %>%
#   mutate(batter1 = rownames(ball_dist_matrix)) %>%
#   pivot_longer(cols = -batter1,
#                names_to = "batter2", values_to = "distance")
# 
# mlb_complete_hclust <-
#   hclust(ball_dist, method = "complete")
# 
# complete_df %>%
#   mutate(ball_clusters = 
#            as.factor(cutree(mlb_complete_hclust, k = 4))) %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = launch_angle, y = hit_distance_sc,
#              color = ball_clusters)) +
#   geom_point(alpha = 0.75) + 
#   theme_bw() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
#   theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
#   labs(x = "Launch Angle",
#        y = "Hit Distance",
#        legend = "Batted Ball Clusters")
```

## Grouping the Relationship Between Launch Angle and Hit Distance by Batted Ball Type
```{r echo = FALSE}
better_players %>%
   filter(effective_speed > 60) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = launch_angle,
             y = hit_distance_sc,
             color = bb_type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind(labels = c("Fly Ball", "Ground Ball", "Line Drive", "Popup")) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Launch Angle",
       y = "Hit Distance",
       color = "Batted Ball Type")
```
???
- While these groups aren't the same as the clusters, it makes sense that coloring the first scatterplot shown by batted ball type shows that different hits are associated with different launch angle and hit distance pairings. Looking at this graph you can see the clusters from the previous graph would definitely be similar in terms of batted ball types.
---

## Where do Desirable Events Lie on the Relationship Between Launch Angle and Hit Distance?
```{r echo = FALSE}
better_players %>%
   filter(effective_speed > 60,
          events %in% (c("single", "triple", "double", "home_run"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = launch_angle,
             y = hit_distance_sc,
             color = events)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Launch Angle",
       y = "Hit Distance",
       legend = "Type of Batted Ball")
```
???
- So I then wanted to compare the clusters to certain event types, and here are displayed the events single, double, triple, and home run. Again, while the these groupings don't exactly line up with the clusters , there would definitely be similarity in event types within clusters.

## R Shiny Demo (hyp. 3)
How Does Variability In Baseball Stadiums Impact Batting Statistics?

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avaitt/cmsacamp-eda-project/main/elevationv2.jpg)
]

???
- Variability in MLB Baseball Stadium stems from **stadium design and stadium location**
- One school of thought suggests that the height of a stadium's outfield wall has some affect on batting statistics (i.e. Fenway Park's notorious "Green Monster")
- Another school of thought suggsets that stadiums at a higher altitude offer conditions for faster balls, and longer hit distances
- Home Game Data for Bluejays removed since they played their 2021 season in a florida baseball stadium

## Investigating Correlation (hyp. 3)

```{r}
v3 <- readRDS("adhvaith_table.rds")
v3 %>%
gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Most Correlated Batting and Stadium Statistics**")
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(md("data courtesy of baseballsavant.com")) %>%
  opt_table_outline( style = "solid", width = px(5), color = "darkgrey")
```

##Conclusion

* Hit location is not uniformly distributed
  + Nonobvious player features influence hit location outcomes  
<p> </p>  

* Bases run is a function of hit distance 
  + Some batters are more efficient base runners  
<p> </p>
* <p> Different stadiums affect game outcomes </p>
* <p> Type of hit may be a feature of the data </p>
